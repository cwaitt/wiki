* Policies and Procedures
** Conferences
Dr. Schneider strongly encourage group members to present their research at conferences. In attending conferences, it is advised to follow the proper procedure listed by the university. Information about attending conferences can be found on the [[./Conferences.org][Conferences]] page.
** Publishing
As part of the doctoral or post-doctoral responsibilities, group members are expected to publish high quality papers as  as they can. Information about publishing in the group can be found on the [[./Publishing.org][Publishing]] page.

** Reviewing
Before a scientific paper is published, it goes through peer review.  Information on the review process can be found on the [[./Reviewing.org][Reviewing]] page.

** Group citizenship
Be nice to everyone in the group, and leave the group better than you found it.
Be a team-player and voluntarily contribute your skillset to the group.

** (Semi-)Annual Reports
At the end of (June and ) December each year Dr. Schneider would like an "accomplishments" report to use as a basis for a one-on-one discussion about research progress, future research directions, graduation plans, and post graduation plans. A Google template of the report is available [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iE3TTGabHms91O3ROaeS4I6eMvXUWOcUPAnLGrt7Hlg/edit][here]]. (Create a copy before typing in this!)  Someone needs to create an org version!

** Work Week and Time Off
Graduate school is generally not a 40 hour a week job, at least if you hope to graduate before funding runs out. Work hard and have fun. Some people are early birds, some are night owls. Whatever the case, try to be in the office between the hours 10 am - 4 pm, when most meetings are held. The University has a number of holidays, plus you are "officially" given two weeks a year of vacation. Be courteous and let your coworkers and supervisors know when you'll be out of the office.

When you are sick, please stay home.  No one in CoMSEL is interested in sharing your germs.

** Group computers
Group computers are hosted by the Center for Research Computing (CRC). For more information about CRC and running jobs, please visit [[http://crc.nd.edu][Notre Dame Center for Research Computing website]].

Group members are to contact senior post-docs for replacement of computers and peripherals via email or slack.
