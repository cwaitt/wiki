# Schneider Group Boot Camp

## Introduction

In the Schenider group, we use a variety of tools in order to complete a particular set of tasks: VASP for DFT and AIMD calculations, ASE for atom visualization and Manipulation, Python for data analysis, VESTA to make pretty molecular images, EMACS/SCIMAX to write outlines and publications, and many more. You may find a particular method or set or programs that works best for you and you should continue to use them. However, what works best for you may not work best for someone else. Additionally, since we are a close knit group, who likes to help each other; when one person asks another for help and they have two completely different methodologies to complete similar tasks, you may find it difficult to assist since no one correct way to answer their question.

The objective of this living document is too create a "unified" methodology that all the Schneider Group Students can follow (new or experienced) in order to:

1. Optimize performance and efficiency

2. Create an environment that promotes communication and collaboration between your collegues

3. Provide a reference document which contains examples and demonstrations on tools that the group has found paticularly useful the past few years

After reading through this bootcamp, you will not be a master in Python, DFT calculations, LaTeX, etc., but you will gain introductory experience to the tools and trade of our craft. Mastery will only come after practice and these pages are designed so that newer generations of students don't need to constantly *re-invent the wheel*.

## New Students

One of the most overwhleming experiences as a new student is trying to understand: 

1. How does my computer/software/code work? 

2. The terminology people use such as compute nodes, scratch space, ssh, sftp, parralell computing, etc., 

3. Given all these vast resources, where do I start? 

And to be perfectly honest its difficult for the experienced students to explain it properly. The CRC does an okay job at explaining some [basic concepts](https://docs.crc.nd.edu/new_user/quick_start.html) but doesn't nessicarilly draws connections to how it directly impacts your research. On top of that, you are likely also trying to learn some external like python. 

There is probably no one right answer on where you should start learning. The new group page introduces you to GitHub, Zotero, Linux, and Python, which are great places to start. These exercises are going to be designed assuming you have some very basic/foundational footing on how these things work. For example, a tutorial on "How to submit a job from a Python Script", will assume you have the knowlege on how to navigate to log into the CRC, navigate to a folder using Linux commands, and open a Jupyter notebook. If you are struggling with a particular task, *talk to one of your groupmates* as they have probably gone through the same issues you have. But remember, if you want to ask for help, and you are using different methods to complete a task than the group is familiar with, you may not get the help you were looking for. Try your up most best to follow the spirit of these tutorials take and deviate from them at your own risk.

## Senior Student

On that note, it is the senior students responsibility to make sure the new students dont get too lost when they begin their project. If you notice a new student doing something you haven't seen before, or if you see them writing code in a new text editor, suggest to them that they should stick to the approved methods discussed here. If they dont want to and want to take the risk of doing something outside of the percieved "correct" way we have been doing it, let them go at it. We should also recognize that all of us have developed different ways of completing a task and its going to be pretty hard to change our behaviors now. For example, it is suggested that we use Jupyter Notebooks to write our python codes, but if you use emacs and are comfortable with it, there should be no pressure to change. However, in an attempt to standiardize certain approaches, we should be consistent in how we help our fellow group memebers. As such, every so often we should get together and discuss what the standard approaches to complete a task should be. Right now, Jupyter Notebooks are the prefered choice to write code in, but maybe 5 years from now a new/better python text editor will make its way into the group.

Our objective as the senior students in the Schneider Group is to document and provided examples of how we efficiently and effectively do our jobs to help the new students succeed and thrive, as well as document new/innovative tools so that we do not need to *reinvent the wheel*. This is a living document and should be continually updated. One person should be responsible for asking other group members to contibute to this page and sees that it is maintained appropriately. You should present what you would like to update on this page to the group to get there feed back, then included documentation and examples in this GitHub repository in the same manner as other examples.
